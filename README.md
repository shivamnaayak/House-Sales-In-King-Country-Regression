# About House-Sales-In-King-Country-Regression
The project "House Sales in King Country Regression" aims to analyze and develop a regression model to predict house sales prices in King Country, a specific region or county. By utilizing historical sales data and relevant features, the project seeks to create a reliable model that can estimate house prices and identify the significant factors influencing the housing market in the area.

## The primary objectives of the project are as follows:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: The project will involve acquiring a robust dataset of house sales in King Country, ensuring the inclusion of relevant features and eliminating any missing or inconsistent data. The dataset will be thoroughly cleaned and prepared for regression analysis.

Feature Selection and Engineering: The project will select the most relevant features from the dataset that have a significant impact on house prices. Additionally, feature engineering techniques may be employed to derive new features or transform existing ones, enhancing the predictive power of the model.

Regression Model Development: The project will build a regression model using the selected features and the target variable (house sale price). Various regression techniques such as linear regression, multiple regression, or advanced models like random forests or gradient boosting may be employed. The model will be trained on a subset of the data and validated using appropriate evaluation metrics.
